# Psychic-Game
- Do you have psychic power and can read a computers mind? If yes, play this game and test your abilities

## How it works
The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. 

The user has 9 guesses to match the randomly picked letter from the computer.

When the player wins, the Wins counter will be increased and the game starts over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, the Losses counter will be increased and the game (after 9 guesses) restarts without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
