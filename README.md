# Psych-Game
- Do you have psychic power and can read a computers mind? If yes, play this game and test your abilities

----
## How it works
The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. 

The user has 9 guesses to match the randomly picked letter from the computer.

When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart (after 9 guesses) the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
